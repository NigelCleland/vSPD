These modifications are for the stand alone command line version of vSPD.
I'm intending to develop a series of scripts which can be used to run custom scenarios across a wide number of periods, while outputting the results most likely to a Database.

I'm intending to use python to liase with this and will host the pertinent scripts in the ./Python folder. Should hopefully be able to extend this to automatically develop a new Database to dump the results into. Most likely a table per run result.
