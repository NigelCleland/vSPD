vSPD
====

vectorised Scheduling, Pricing and Dispatch

Plan
----

Goal is to develop a Python based interface for vSPD.
This should include:

1. Calling the model
2. Being able to make changes to the GDX files via python (e.g. to run experiments)
3. Outputting information from python and load into DataFrames for analysis
4. Automating the procedure to make running large numbers of experiments possible.
